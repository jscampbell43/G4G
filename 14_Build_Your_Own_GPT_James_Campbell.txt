Question: In SFTTrainer, what does "packing = false" mean?

Answer: Packing is an optimization technique that concatenates multiple short 
training examples in a single longer input sequence to match the "max_length" parameter
for how many tokens a sequence should be. This increases the model's efficiency, 
makes training faster, and promotes better resource use by preventing the need for padding.

Some reasons to set "packing = false" would be: 
To avoid unwanted correlation issues due to examples being stored near each other.
To retain the original structure of the data.
If a data set has only a few very long examples, packing provides no benefit and is therefore unnecessary.
Having "packing = false" gives you more control over preprocessing, tokenization, or sequence formation.
In some cases, having packing = true can cause compatibility issues or errors.
